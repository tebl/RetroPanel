# SD35VC0 (FP1)
A faceplate designed to be installed onto the RetroPanel SD35VC0 [Front](https://github.com/tebl/RetroPanel/tree/main/RetroPanel%20SD35VC0%20Front)-module, it does not have any electrical components and is purely here as a cosmetic option. While this one has cutouts for all relevant features for the RetroPanel SD35VC0, it might be a good idea to [find](https://github.com/tebl/RetroPanel/tree/main/faceplates) one that specifically suits your requirements.

If one has not been made available through the repository, it should be rather easy to modify the files belonging to this design and then remove any cutouts or labels that you do not require. Ask nicely and I may even help you.

# 1> Schematic
The supplied KiCad files should be sufficient as both a schematic and as a  starting point for ordering PCBs (basically you could just zip the contents of the export folder and upload that on a fabrication site), the schematic is also available in [PDF-format](https://github.com/tebl/RetroPanel/tree/main/documentation/schematic/faceplates) and this is what you'll need to print and work your way through when things fail to work as expected.

# 2> BOM
Most parts should be easy to get a hold of from your favourite local electronic component shop, but given that I don't have access to such shops where I live so everything was based on whatever I could get cheapest from eBay/AliExpress (free shipping, but plan on waiting 3-4 weeks for delivery).

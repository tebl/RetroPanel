# Faceplates
The faceplates are for the most part a cosmetic option, but given that not all components will be required or even desired for all builds - I've made a few different options available as part of the repository. If you can't find one that specifically matches what you want, consider using [Faceplate (FP1)](https://github.com/tebl/RetroPanel/tree/main/faceplates/RetroPanel%20FP1) as a starting point and then just delete the parts that you do not need. Also, if there is an obvious combination that you feel should have already been made available - let me know and I'll see if I can get that added.

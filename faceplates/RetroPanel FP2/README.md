# RetroPanel (FP2)
A faceplate designed to be installed onto the RetroPanels [Front](https://github.com/tebl/RetroPanel/tree/main/RetroPanel%20Front)-module, it does not have any electrical components and is purely here as a cosmetic option. This faceplate only have the cutouts for the 7-segment display and the tool button, making it specifically suitable when used as an external display module for common ISA/PCI POST diagnostic cards. Make sure that you [find one](https://github.com/tebl/RetroPanel/tree/main/faceplates) that specifically suits your requirements, alternatively - use [RetroPanel (FP1)](https://github.com/tebl/RetroPanel/tree/main/faceplates/RetroPanel%20FP1) as a starting when creating your own.

- [2> BOM](#2-bom)

# 1> Schematic
The supplied KiCad files should be sufficient as both a schematic and as a  starting point for ordering PCBs (basically you could just zip the contents of the export folder and upload that on a fabrication site), the schematic is also available in [PDF-format](https://github.com/tebl/RetroPanel/tree/main/documentation/schematic/faceplates) and this is what you'll need to print and work your way through when things fail to work as expected.

# 2> BOM
Most parts should be easy to get a hold of from your favourite local electronic component shop, but given that I don't have access to such shops where I live so everything was based on whatever I could get cheapest from eBay/AliExpress (free shipping, but plan on waiting 3-4 weeks for delivery).
